Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method to Solve Differential Equation
Runge Kutta method is used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODE). It uses dy/dx function for x and y, and also need the initial value of y, i.e. y(0). It finds the approximate value of y for given x. For solving ODE, we have to follow these formulas:
