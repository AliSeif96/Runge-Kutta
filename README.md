Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method to Solve Differential Equation

## Runge-Kutta
In numerical analysis, the Runge–Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the well-known routine called the Euler Method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations.[1] These methods were developed around 1900 by the German mathematicians Carl Runge and Wilhelm Kutta.





Runge Kutta method is used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODE). It uses dy/dx function for x and y, and also need the initial value of y, i.e. y(0). It finds the approximate value of y for given x. For solving ODE, we have to follow these formulas:

Here h is the height of the interval.
